# Python_API_Challenge

Worked alot within Google and Stack.
Meet with Ashia my tutor wow got me on my way with a simple stupid mistake in the first part of the WeatherPy.  After I got the API updated, everything was using my notes from Challenge 5 to help me plot and working with my partner Kokoe Amigno.
Had some questions I posed to Chatgpt regarding the appending of data and the counting to get a better understanding for the starter code.
Used coding given in class to help completed all the texts requested
